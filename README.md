## Usage üíª

### Basic Example

Here's a simple example to demonstrate how to use Solanaj to connect to the Solana network and fetch the balance of an account.

```java
import com.devrahul09.solanaj.SolanaClient;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SolanaClient client = new SolanaClient();
        String publicKey = "YourPublicKeyHere";
        double balance = client.getBalance(publicKey);
        System.out.println("Balance: " + balance + " SOL");
    }
}
```

### Advanced Features

#### Sending Transactions

You can send SOL tokens between accounts using the following code:

```java
import com.devrahul09.solanaj.SolanaClient;

public class TransactionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SolanaClient client = new SolanaClient();
        String fromPublicKey = "YourFromPublicKey";
        String toPublicKey = "YourToPublicKey";
        double amount = 0.5;

        client.sendTransaction(fromPublicKey, toPublicKey, amount);
        System.out.println("Transaction sent!");
    }
}
```

#### Working with NFTs

Solanaj also provides support for managing NFTs through Metaplex. Here‚Äôs how you can create an NFT:

```java
import com.devrahul09.solanaj.MetaplexClient;

public class NFTExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MetaplexClient metaplexClient = new MetaplexClient();
        String nftMetadata = "YourNFTMetadata";
        metaplexClient.createNFT(nftMetadata);
        System.out.println("NFT created!");
    }
}
```
